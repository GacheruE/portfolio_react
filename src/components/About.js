            Through internships in the finance and agriculture sectors, I’ve gained practical experience in predictive modelling, automation, and dashboarding using tools like Python, SQL, Power BI, and Excel. I've built fraud detection models, OCR systems, and data-driven reports that support real-world decision-making. I thrive in collaborative environments, value continuous learning, and am driven by the opportunity to create solutions that are both technically sound and impactful.
